# landing-page
#### This was my first web project ever.
* Techniques used:
  * Google fonts used.
	* Four sections added
	* CSS used to change the style for Width less than 600px
	* CSS used to default styles
	* Javascript forEach loop used to add navbar list components.
	* Javascript forEach loops used to change background of the selected section to blue while others to default.
	* Javascript forEach loops used to change background of the selected section's navItem to blue while others to default.
	* Javascript used to change the dimensions of the navbar as hover.
	* Javascript used to scroll into section upon clicking.
* In this project I learned:
  * To use nested loops.
  * The use of fragmentDocument.
  * To use getBoundingClientRect().
  * To use forEach to add sections to the Navbar menu.
# note
#### In the attached picture there is a screenshot from mobile and section 4 is working well unlike the comment in the review.
